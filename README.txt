This project is a Basic Currency Converter (RON/EUR/USD) using Tkinter.

The user can use the application to convert money between the currencies available.

The interface of the currency converter was designed to cover the basic functionalities for a currency converter using only three currencies.

The user can press the buttons to select the currency to convert from and the currency to convert to. There are two labels that specify the currencies selected.
After the user will press the button to convert, a text box with the currency converted will be shown.
